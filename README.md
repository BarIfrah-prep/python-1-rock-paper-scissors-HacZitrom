The code i wrote makes the game Rock Paper Scissors.
By the way Bar i wrote the code with no help from the instructions , just searched in Stack Overflow for the choice function to random.
I know its nothing compared to real projects but i love learning code by trying by myself

## Code input\output\ how to run
With the template you gave there was already import random and a while loop so i started by assigning veriables rock=1 paper=2 and scissors=3 then i wanted to assign a veriable of a question using  input  so if the player wants to play it will save the answer he writes,  and i added an if statment below to check what he chooses if he chosses no the while loop will end because of the break operator i wrote in the else at the end, and if he chooses y or Y  it will make it a lower case in order to compare to the play veriable . if he chooses  yes it will run a new question with the choises.
 i assigned the choices to a veriable and wrote it in a list,
then assigned pc as the veriable that picks a random number from the list of choices
from here its just comparing the user vs the pc and adding the 'want to play?' question to see if the player wants to keep playing .
### This is it! Your assignement instructions are attached in the repository. Good luck!
